## Description
- Motivation: Our motivation for making this was to create something functional that we can use daily in our own lives.
- Why: We chose this idea because we felt that there's a lack of daily task tracking applications that help you plan your day.
- What problem does this solve: This application keeps you from forgetting your most important items for the day by providing an easy place to aggregate your tasks.
- What I learned: We learned a lot about how routes work and how to utilize handlebars.js to create HTML pages.
- Challanges: Working with conditionals in handlebars proved to be very challenging.
